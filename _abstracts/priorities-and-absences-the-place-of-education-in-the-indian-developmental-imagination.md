It has often been said that education, and in particular pre-tertiary education, was a neglected aspect of developmental planning in India. The purpose of this paper is to examine the conceptualisation of education in the Indian developmental imagination in order to examine the conceptualisation of how education was supposed to work. Returning to earlier debates in the last years of British rule in India, and formulating how breaks and discontinuities were supposed to operate, but also looking at resource allocation, priorities, and the imagined duties of citizens educated in a secular manner, as well as the formulation of early textbooks and syllabi, I hope to suggest that a top-heavy educational policy was the ill-considered outcome of a developmental imagination in which education was insufficiently thought through, leaving space for non-state actors to intervene in crucial ways in terms of both structure and content.
