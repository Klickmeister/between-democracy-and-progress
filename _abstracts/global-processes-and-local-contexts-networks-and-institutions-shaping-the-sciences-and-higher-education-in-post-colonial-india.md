This paper argues that higher education in the task of nation building in post-colonial India was steered by several larger processes that influenced the institutional evolution of higher education. These had to do with the massification of the university, as its role in the future of national development came to be increasingly recognised by governments the world over; and the second had to do with what could be labelled the second wave of decolonisation in India, which coincides with political decolonisation in other parts of the world. In the world of the sciences, there was an earlier history of movements such as internationalism that played a role in shaping the imaginary of salient academic communities of scientists. In post-colonial India, as argued elsewhere, the institutionalisation of the sciences and the shaping of higher education was never seen as the dismantling of colonial scientific institutions and legacies but of rearranging and reorienting the colonial agenda to the demands of a sovereign nation â€“ the idea of leap-frogging (Raina and Jain, 1997) was fore-grounded in policy circles. While a great deal of postcolonial history has sort to chronicle this process, it would be important to reckon with international movements, networks, processes and resources that shaped the trajectory of the sciences in the long 1950s. The paper attempts to trace the dynamics of this process.
