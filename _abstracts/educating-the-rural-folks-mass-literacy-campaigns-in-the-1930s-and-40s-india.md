This paper will explore the history of rural literacy in light of the mass literacy campaigns launched by the colonial state in the 1930s and 40s. These campaigns were launched by the Indian political parties that formed local governments in the 1930s. These governments were constituted as part of the self-government initiatives of the colonial government, which was unwilling to give up the power but willing to share it with Indians. The history of mass literacy tells us how a large majority of the Indian countryside was educated in the modern period. I place these initiatives in the light of a global history of rural literacy campaigns, i.e., in Russia, Cuba, etc. The paper focuses on methods, approaches, and networks of literacy campaigns and the challenges of literacy initiatives in colonial society. It allows us to understand the making of a modern democracy which would go under universal franchise in 1947. My paper uses methods of social history to understand reports of mass literacy campaigns.
