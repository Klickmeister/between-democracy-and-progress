South Asian History, as an academic discipline, for most of its existence has gravitated towards a simple dichotomy: imperialism-colonialism on the one hand, and the growing vigour of anti-colonial attitudes and aspirations of the Indians on the other. This dominant framework under which varieties of Nationalist and Marxist histories were written often occluded many social and cultural histories of religion, caste, gender, and provincialism that were positioned outside it. As an exemplar of the said paradigm, this paper brings to light the lesser-known history of the first attempt to write the ‘Official History’ of the Indian freedom struggle. The trade-offs between professional historians and the Indian state on what would constitute the ‘National History’ with an official emboss has a long bearing on how History is still taught across schools and universities in India. This paper argues how the ‘Official History’, as an unintended consequence, informed the writing of school textbooks and constructed the core of history textbook controversies in independent India. Looking closely at the events of how RC Majumdar (1888-1980) who was initially commissioned to write the ‘Official History’ was dropped from the project, and a more acceptable Tara Chand (1888-1973) was brought in raises a number of questions on the interrelation between historians and the state and the rise of statism in the production of historical knowledge. Using the archives of Ministry of Education, Indian History Congress, National Council of Educational Research and Training, private papers of Majumdar, and contemporary sources, this paper sheds light on the intricate and inconsistent processes of the making of idea(s) of an ‘Official’ India and its various representations in school education.
