Independent India's first leaders devoted considerable efforts towards furthering adult education. Doing so was central to the imagination of India as a democracy where citizens would responsibly exercise their right to vote. Adult education was also an important element in fostering the changes in agricultural practices that were regarded as essential to feed a hungry nation. This paper surveys adult education more broadly, and then narrows in on an initiative called Radio Farm Forums. Pioneered with the help of UNESCO and initially introduced in Bombay State in 1956, radio farm forms were a new form of pedagogy for India's rural population. They delivered what their social scientist designers understood to be 'new knowledge' through entertaining programmes, which were then followed by group discussions at the village level. The topics varied from village sanitation, water conservation and new farming methods, to adult education and the value of educating one's children. The paper charts the amazement of the social scientists conducting this experiment, as their expectations about a passive, stagnant and homogenous rural India were upended.
