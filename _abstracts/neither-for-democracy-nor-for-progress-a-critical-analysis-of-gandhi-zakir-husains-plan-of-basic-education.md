On October 1937, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and the education ministers of the provinces where the Indian National Congress had established governments decided to decolonise education by replacing the curriculum of primary schools. They constituted a committee consisting of a group of educationists trained in the universities of Europe and the United States. Headed by Zakir Husain, the vice chancellor of Jamia Milia Islamia in Delhi and later president of India, this group formulated a primary school curriculum combining indigenous and colonial subjects. It formulated a curriculum for Spinning and Weaving, Social Studies (Social Sciences), Mathematics, Language (mother tongue), General Science and Drawing for classes 1 to 7. The Committee explicitly stated that the new curriculum aimed to ‘develop a broad human interest in the progress of mankind in general and of India in particular, to develop in the pupil a proper understanding of his social and geographical environment; and to awaken the urge to improve it, to inculcate the love of the motherland, reverence for its past, and a belief in its future destiny as the home of a united co-operative society based on love, truth and justice, to develop a sense of the rights and responsibilities of citizenship’ and ‘finally to develop mutual respect for the world religions a reverential study of the different religions’ was included. Taking into consideration, among others, criticisms advanced by anti-colonial leaders like Lajpat Rai and Aurobindo Ghosh, this presentation will critically analyse how far these objectives were fulfilled through the enactment of this curriculum.
