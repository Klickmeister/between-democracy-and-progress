Women’s education emerges as an important agenda in nationalist literature of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century in India. This presentation will look at early attempts by women to recommend policies for women’s education in the emerging nation-state. It will examine documents from the 1940s, starting with the report commissioned by the National Planning Committee in 1938, on the Women's Role in the Planned Economy, which was published on the eve of India's independence. It will also examine the reports of the National Committee on Women's Education (also referred to as Durgabai Deshmukh Committee, 1959 and Hansa Mehta Committee 1962). The paper will attempt to look at the ways in which these early efforts by women of the nationalist elites envisioned policies to further women’s education in the early post-colonial nation-state. It will examine the multiple and sometimes contradictory stances on the aims of girls’ and women’s education in the democratic nation, in relation to their roles in production and social reproduction and especially in relation to family, childcare, labour and sexuality.
