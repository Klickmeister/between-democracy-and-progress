During the early decades of independent life in India, material scarcity and expanding enrolment in universities across the country led to student unrest and growing political tensions. Taking forward a long-standing tradition of radical politicization, university students became increasingly critical of the Nehruvian state. Student politics focused on the material and institutional shortcomings of Indian higher education, but also linked with the defence of different conceptions of socialist transformation, Gandhian ideals of autonomy and swaraj, and diverse agendas of anti-Nehruvian opposition. This paper will look at the involvement of Jayaprakash Narayan (1902-1979) with student politics in Early Post-Colonial India. Well known for his crucial leadership role in the student protest movement that led to the declaration of the Emergency in 1974-1975, JP was active in different student agitations throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Having started his political career as a student activist in 1919, during those decades Narayan recurred to student politics as a way of promoting a novel form of lok niti, or people´s politics, and structuring a potent critique of Nehruvian nation-building that blended national, and at times very local, concerns with transregional strands of anti-statist critique of developmental nationalism taking shape across the Third World. His involvement with student politics proved crucial to the emergence of the Indian face of what Robert Altbach described in 1970 as “The International Student Revolution”.
