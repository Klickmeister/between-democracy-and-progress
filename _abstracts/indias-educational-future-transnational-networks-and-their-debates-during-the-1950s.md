After India’s independence, education was imagined and mobilised as a vital instrument for decolonisation and building the new independent nation state. Negotiating India’s educational future was not only a domestic affair. As India was perceived as a critical site for the outcome of the evolving Cold War power struggle and for establishing geopolitical stability, India’s educational future attracted attention from the international community in a still overwhelmingly imperial world. State powers and international organisations played an active role in shaping the educational policy debates in India during the 1950s by facilitating and funding the exchange of ideas and people. This paper explores how India’s educational future was discussed and debated in a dense transnational network of politicians, experts, and consultants that included domestic leading educationalists and politicians, like Humayun Kabir, as well as representatives from internationally operating organizations, such as the Ford Foundation and UNESCO. Using materials collected in multi-archival research, this paper aims to highlight the recursive interaction between the “domestic” and “international” domains in the social and political process of formulating new ideas and solutions for educational development. It argues that the educational imaginaries that were produced in this network were not merely replications of Western imaginaries, nor simply the product of a domestic political process, and must be understood as part of a process of post-colonial world-making.
