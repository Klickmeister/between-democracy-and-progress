The presentation focuses on the emergence and successive transformations of the leading concepts and international references when contouring the field of educational planning in India. It focuses on the period between the transfer of competencies over education to Indians and the death of Nehru. It will delineate the intricate discussion related to the main concept of planning and the specifics of education planning as a particular challenge for the worldview of planning. It will elaborate on different circulating transnational models of education planning and its changing references including Western welfare states, the Soviet Union, the UNESCO-approach, and the emergence of an own developmentalist outlook. Not only the problem of the main concepts and references are in focus, but also a panorama of the institutionalization of the field, and the specific role of educators and pedagogues in this endeavour.
