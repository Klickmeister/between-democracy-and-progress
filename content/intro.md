The conference “Between democracy and progress?” Development, Nation Building and Education in Early Post-Colonial India (1930-1964) brings together scholarship from different fields, including history, economy, education, developmental studies, and political sciences to discuss the formation of India’s educational complex as part of the wider process of nation building. The conference also discusses how the dilemmas and challenges in India’s transition to independence have been formative for the further development of India’s educational landscape. Papers should cover discussions, projects, and policies from the final years of colonial rule to the end of the classic developmental approach related with Nehru’s tenure.
